# Project Manager


I created this application in a time when I needed a single app where I was able keep track of my university classes and personal projects as well,

I wanted to ideally know the state of different projects,
document stuff, (class notes, new insights, etc) while
also keeping track of my classes, meetings and upcoming deadlines;
One important aspect, is that it should be private (I decided to use Local-storage instead of any cloud service)

### Overview

The app should include:

- Task management system
- Creation/Edition of documents
- Meetings & Deadlines tracker
- Calendar view

It needed to have a nice UI, since I wanted to have a pleasent experience while using it ðŸ˜€
